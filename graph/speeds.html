<h3>1 million transactions</h3>

<canvas id="myChart" width="1024" height="800"></canvas>

<p>Blue bars are write speed. White bars are read speed.</p>

<p>Bottom axis is number of buckets for hashtable, and the disk size the
header occupied.</p>

<p>Test is with 971698 txs (443973598 bytes). We expect slower performance
for LevelDB BTREE at higher counts, whereas the hashtree should remain constant
with an unchanging load factor (number txs / number buckets).</p>

<p>We expect random access for Bitcoin transactions, and the dataset is huge,
so cache perfomance is not important for us.</p>
